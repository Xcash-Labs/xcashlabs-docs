# Vote & Staking

!!! warning ""
    Currently you can vote from the CLI wallet, Android wallet, and GUI wallet.

## Find Your Delegate

All delegates are listed on the delegate explorer.

!!! danger "Unverified Delegate Information"
    Delegate explorer information may be self-reported by delegates.  
    There may be no automated checks verifying fees, payouts, or claims.

!!! info ""
    Most delegates discuss openly on the official community Discord.  
    We recommend joining the discussion and asking questions before voting.

## Delegate Types

You will find 2 types of delegates:

- **Shared Delegates**
  - Public delegates you can vote for
  - Typically redistribute your share of rewards minus fees
  - As a voter, you should only vote for shared delegates

- **Solo Delegates**
  - Delegates that redistribute rewards only to a select group 

## Staking Calculation

!!! note ""
    Rewards are **not guaranteed** and are **not a fixed ROI**.

    Block producer selection is based on VRF randomness, where the delegate with the **lowest VRF beta** wins the round.
    Because of this, rewards are probabilistic and may vary significantly over time depending on network conditions,
    total stake distribution, delegate participation, and fees.


## Voting Rules

!!! info "Voting Rules"
    - **You can only have one vote per wallet.**
    - You need a minimum of `2,000,000` coins in the wallet to vote. *(update if XCash-Labs differs)*
    - Spending from the staked wallet amount cancels the vote.
