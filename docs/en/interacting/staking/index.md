# Vote & Staking

!!! warning ""
    Currently you can vote from the CLI wallet, Android wallet, and GUI wallet.  
    X-Bank does not have the ability to vote yet.

## Find Your Delegate

All delegates are listed on the delegate explorer.

!!! danger "Unverified Delegate Information"
    Delegate explorer information may be self-reported by delegates.  
    There may be no automated checks verifying fees, payouts, or claims.

!!! info ""
    Most delegates discuss openly on the official community Discord.  
    We recommend joining the discussion and asking questions before voting.

## Delegate Types

You will find 3 types of delegates:

- **Shared Delegates**
  - Public delegates you can vote for
  - Typically redistribute your share of rewards minus fees
  - As a voter, you should usually favor shared delegates

- **Solo Delegates**
  - Usually elected by themselves
  - Keep the rewards for themselves
  - You may vote for them, but do not expect rewards

- **Private Group**
  - Delegates that redistribute rewards only to a select group
  - Usually arranged privately
  - Avoid voting unless you have confirmed membership/terms

## Staking Calculation

You can calculate your expected ROI depending on several factors.

- ROI Calculator: *(link if still valid)*
- Delegate comparison sheets: *(optional)*

!!! note ""
    ROI calculators are estimates only. Rewards depend on network conditions,
    delegate uptime, fees, and other factors.

## Voting Rules

!!! info "Voting Rules"
    - **You can only have one vote per wallet.**
    - Votes are taken into account at the **top of the next hour**.
    - You need a minimum of `2,000,000` coins in the wallet to vote. *(update if XCash-Labs differs)*
    - Spending from the staked wallet amount cancels the vote.

You can view the staked and unstaked balance anytime:
